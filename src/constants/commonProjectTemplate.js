I had a hard time researching for this project because there are no other similar product out there in the market. But the final results still made me proud, I feel like product designers like me and you both needs an app like this exclusively just made for us. I do not think I did great on researching for this project as I should have interviewed more users to get more helpful opinions on this project, but hopefully I can do that on the next steps! Thank you for reading this far! I hope you have a wonderful day!"
